Review:

Hello Abdul,

The message of this plot is very clear, I see how just a few countries produce more food than even the rest of the top 10. In terms of execution, I have a few suggestions:
-	I believe that the font size on the axes is a little too small for comfortable observation.
-	If you could orient the names of the countries horizontally, it would improve the graph’s readability.
-	Finally, I think that the title of your visualization is a little confusing. I think you could express the same idea in a more straightforward manner. “Nations with the Highest Food Production in 2012” comes to mind as an alternative title.

A simple bar graph is the proper representation of this data. You do not try to overcomplicate the data with distractions or chart junk. Instead your visualization just presents the data. Finally, this plot is honest in its representation of the data. With bar graphs, some may be tempted to truncate the vertical axis to lie with the data, but you do not do this. Overall, this is a solid visualization which could use just a few minor tweaks.
